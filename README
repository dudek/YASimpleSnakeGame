This is simple snake game, based on double linked list structure, in text mode.
The game was written for educational purposes.
It is possible to play two people (hot-seat ;)), to run game in two player mode
just run program with tp argument.
Example:
	./snake tp
P1 controls	P2 controls
W S A D		I K J L

Second "feature" ;-) gives possible to set game speed, you can do that by
running program with decimal argument from 0(slowest) to 9(fastest).
Example (game in snail speed mode):
	./snake 0
Ofcourse you can use both arguments at the same time ;).
To compile you need a C compiler and ncurses library installed.
Ncurses library:
