YetAnotherSimpleSnakeGame, that is just yet another simple snake game, based on double linked list structure, in text mode.
The game was written some time ago, for educational purposes. I pushed it on github because I'm new user and I wanted
to test how it works.
It is possible to play two people (hot-seat ;)), to run game in two player mode
just run program with tp argument.
Example:
	./snake tp
P1 controls	P2 controls
W S A D		I K J L

Second "feature" ;-) gives possible to set game speed, you can do that by
running program with decimal argument from 0(slowest) to 9(fastest).
Example (game in snail speed mode):
	./snake 0
To compile you need a C compiler and ncurses library installed.
Ncurses library:

I have some ideas how I could develop this game (for example: multiplayer via network) and
maybe when I will have more time (and willingness) I will handle this.
All comments in source code are in polish.
